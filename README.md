# graph-and-table
Yobota exercise

GENERAL

- Took much longer than expected to do the exercise due to unfamiliarity with visualisation and material UI libraries.

- Styles are a bit messy as I wanted just wanted a quick fix, rather than a structured CSS architecture

- included setTimeout function into actions to simulate delayed response from a server

TABLE

- Table sorting works
- Filtering also works. I haven't added autocomplete as the table filters as you type. Would have used: https://material-ui.com/components/autocomplete/
- For the table inline editing I would have used a library called React-Grid. The link to their editing feature is: https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/docs/guides/editing/

GRAPHS

- Graphs can be filtered by industry

- Date of birth was not the most exciting attribute to plot graphs.

- First graph is a scatter graph that shows the relationship between date of birth and salary. I expected to find some  correlation, but there doesn't seem to be one.

- Second graph is just a general analysis of number of people vs year of birth. Again, no big trend to see here.
